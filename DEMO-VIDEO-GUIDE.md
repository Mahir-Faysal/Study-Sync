# 🎥 StudySync - Demonstration Video Guide & Script

This guide provides a complete script and step-by-step instructions to help you create a professional and comprehensive demonstration video for your StudySync project.

## 📝 General Recording Tips
- **Screen Recording Software**: Use a good screen recorder like OBS Studio (free), Camtasia, or the built-in screen recorder in Windows/macOS.
- **Clear Audio**: Use a decent microphone. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.
- **Preparation**: Have all necessary windows open before you start: your code editor (VS Code), a terminal, and a web browser.
- **Practice**: Do a dry run of the script to ensure a smooth delivery.
- **Resolution**: Record in at least 1080p for clarity.

## 🎬 Video Script & Instructions

### **Part 1: Individual Introduction** (Approx. 30 seconds)

**(What to show: Your face, if you're comfortable, or a title slide with your name and project title.)**

**Script:**
> "Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I'm excited to present my final project: **StudySync**, an interactive learning and assessment platform.
>
> In this video, I'll give you an overview of the project idea, walk you through its technical structure, preview the code, and demonstrate the live application workflow."

---

### **Part 2: Project Idea Summary** (Approx. 1 minute)

**(What to show: The `README.md` file, focusing on the "Features" section.)**

**Script:**
> "StudySync is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between learning and assessment. It provides a seamless experience for both educators and students.
>
> For **educators**, or 'Question Setters', the platform allows them to create and manage a bank of questions, build exams, and view detailed analytics on student performance.
>
> For **students**, it offers a platform to take exams, track their results and progress over time, and participate in a Q&A forum to collaborate with peers.
>
> The core idea is to create a dynamic, role-based educational ecosystem with secure authentication, real-time feedback, and data-driven insights."

---

### **Part 3: Project Structure** (Approx. 2 minutes)

**(What to show: Switch to VS Code. First, show the `README.md` file's "Project Structure" section with the diagrams. Then, open the file explorer to show the actual folders.)**

**Script:**
> "Now, let's dive into the project's structure. As you can see in the `README.md`, the project is a classic monorepo, cleanly separated into two main parts: a **Spring Boot backend** and a **React frontend**."
>
> *(Point to the `backend` and `frontend` folders in the file explorer.)*
>
> "The **backend** is a standard Maven project. Inside `src/main/java`, you'll find the core application logic, organized by feature:
> - `controller` for handling API requests.
> - `service` for the business logic.
> - `repository` for data access.
> - `model` for our database entities.
> - `security` for handling JWT authentication and authorization.
>
> The **frontend** is a Create React App. The `src` folder contains all our React components, which are also organized by feature, such as `auth`, `exams`, and `questions`. The `services` folder handles all communication with the backend API.
>
> I've also included several scripts like `start.bat` and `start-h2.bat` to make it easy for anyone to run the project, even without having PostgreSQL installed, by using an in-memory H2 database."

---

### **Part 4: Overall Code Preview** (Approx. 3 minutes)

**(What to show: Open and briefly scroll through the files as you mention them.)**

**Script:**
> "Let's take a quick look at some key code snippets.
>
> **On the backend:**
> 1. **`pom.xml`**: Here, you can see all our backend dependencies, including Spring Boot starters for Web, Data JPA, and Security, as well as PostgreSQL and H2 drivers, and JWT libraries.
> 2. **`SecurityConfig.java`**: This is the heart of our backend security. It configures our security filter chain, defines protected and public routes, and sets up our authentication provider.
> 3. **`QuestionController.java`**: This is a good example of a REST controller. It defines endpoints for CRUD operations on questions and is protected by role-based access, ensuring only 'Question Setters' can access it.
> 4. **`Question.java`**: This is a JPA entity, representing the 'questions' table in our database. It uses standard Hibernate annotations.
>
> **Moving to the frontend:**
> 1. **`package.json`**: This file lists our frontend dependencies, like React, React Bootstrap, Axios for API calls, and Chart.js for analytics.
> 2. **`App.js`**: This is our main component, where we define all the client-side routes using React Router, directing users to different components based on the URL.
> 3. **`Login.js`**: Here's a look at one of our professional UI components. It uses React hooks for state management, handles form submission, and features a modern design with icons and a password visibility toggle.
> 4. **`AuthService.js`**: This service encapsulates the logic for making API calls to the backend's authentication endpoints. It handles user login, registration, and manages the JWT token in the browser's local storage."

### **Part 5: Application Workflow Demonstration** (Approx. 5-7 minutes)

**(What to show: Your terminal and web browser. Follow these steps live.)**

**Script:**
> "Now for the most exciting part: a live demonstration of the application workflow.
>
> **1. Starting the Application:**
> "First, I'll run the `start-h2.bat` script. This starts both the backend and frontend servers using the in-memory H2 database, so no external database is needed."
>
> *(Run the script and wait for the servers to start. Open `http://localhost:3000`.)*
>
> **2. Registering a Question Setter:**
> "Here is our professionally styled login page. Since we have no users yet, I'll register a new 'Question Setter' account."
>
> *(Go to the register page, fill in the details, and select the 'Question Setter' role.)*
>
> **3. Creating Questions and an Exam:**
> "Now logged in as a Question Setter, you can see the dashboard. I'll navigate to the 'Question Manager' and create a few multiple-choice questions."
>
> *(Quickly create 2-3 questions.)*
>
> "With our questions ready, I'll go to the 'Exam Manager' to create a new exam. I'll give it a title, and select the questions I just made. I'll save it as a draft, and then... I'll activate it, making it live for students."
>
> **4. Registering a Student:**
> "Next, I'll log out and register a 'Student' account to show the other side of the platform."
>
> *(Log out, register a new user with the 'STUDENT' role.)*
>
> **5. Taking the Exam:**
> "Logged in as a student, the dashboard looks different. I'll go to 'Take Exam', where I can see the active exam we just created. I'll start the exam, answer the questions... and submit."
>
> *(Answer the questions, some correctly, some incorrectly. Submit the exam.)*
>
> **6. Viewing Results:**
> "Immediately after submission, the student can see their score, the correct answers, and whether they passed. This result is also stored permanently in their 'My Results' page."
>
> **7. Viewing Analytics (as Question Setter):**
> "Finally, let's see what the Question Setter sees. I'll log back in as our first user."
>
> *(Log out and log back in as the Question Setter.)*
>
> "Now, if I go to the 'Analytics' dashboard, I can see the results for the exam that was just taken. The system provides a breakdown of scores and performance, which would become more detailed as more students complete the exam. This provides valuable feedback to the educator."

---

### **Part 6: Conclusion** (Approx. 30 seconds)

**(What to show: The final application screen, perhaps the analytics dashboard.)**

**Script:**
> "That concludes the demonstration of StudySync. We've built a robust, full-stack application with role-based security, a clean, professional UI, and a complete workflow for both educators and students.
>
> Thank you for watching!"
